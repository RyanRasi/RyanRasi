## Hi I'm Ryan

ðŸ‘‹ An accomplished Cloud Engineer with a knack for translating complex tech concepts into practical solutions. Currently, I'm contributing my skills and expertise as a Cloud Engineer at Avanade in London.

ðŸš€ My academic journey in technology was last at the University of Reading where I earned my MSc in Advanced Computer Science. Prior to that, I completed my BSc in Computer Science with Marketing at Keele University, setting the stage for a well-rounded technical and strategic foundation. I am currently completing a PhD by publication part-time on developing a safe and explainable autonomous driving and rail transport algorithm using computer vision.

ðŸ’¡ As a Microsoft Certified professional in Azure Fundamentals, I thrive on navigating the intricacies of cloud architecture and infrastructure. My experience includes working with clients in the healthcare and defence industries, where I acted as an Azure SME as well as software engineer.

ðŸŒŸ Outside the world of tech, I'm an avid snowboarder, sailor, and golfer. These activities keep me energised and ready to take on challenges, whether they're on the slopes, out at sea, or on the green.
